# sharedbrain

sharedbrain is a simple pre-processor for Hugo markdown files. I was
inspired by [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), which presents backlinks for all
of your notes and automatically generates pages for notes you haven't created yet.
sharedbrain does something similarâ€¦ you can take a directory edited with [nvALT](https://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/),
for example, and generate from that a set of posts ready to run through Hugo
to generate a site.

It's certainly possible to share Roam notes directory, but I wanted a more "published" form,
running on my own domain.
